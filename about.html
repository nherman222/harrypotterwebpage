          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi there! My name is Nina Herman and I'm a sophomore at Dartmouth
            College pursuing a major in Computer Science and a minor in
            Economics.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've moved four times but all to houses within 30 minutes of each
            other, just outside Phildelphia (it's a long story). I love to play
            squash and tennis, do yoga, and hike. (And, clearly, I love Harry
            Potter. But who doesn't?)
          </p>
          <p>
            As for developing, VS code is my go-to. My favorite part of
            developing is the planning. I love talking through how I plan to
            implement an idea (whether that's talking to myself or others). I
            love scribbling on a piece of paper for hours until I finally
            understand how I'm going to bring what was previously just an idea
            to life.
          </p>
          <p>
            With DALI, I’m most excited to think through how to implement ideas
            with other people who share my excitement for developing.
            Additionally, I hope to use my skills to develop applications and
            technologies that have a measurable impact on people’s lives and
            lifestyles. Not only am I excited to apply and hone my current
            skills, but I enjoy learning new ones, too. I had a great time
            developing this webpage by learning through YouTube, and I hope to
            continue to build upon my skills by applying them in an environment
            like DALI.
